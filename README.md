# Prominence2MC-Modpack-DataBase
An Analysis of the different values and not-disclosed information included in the Prominence 2 Hausterian Modpack available on CurseForge. No copyrighted code is shown in this repository. Please contact me if you find copywritten code to remove it from the repository; if you have proof that any is shown (compared to source code, not decompiled). This is for Wiki and informational purposes. I gain no commercial incentives to do so. I do so because I love the modpack (but I really really really want them to undo their removal of the XP Charm part of the charms mod, I made so many of those on the server I play on). Please check out the modpack it is incredible! https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/prominence-2-hasturian-era
(btw HackThePlanet.now has a great community for a server for this modpack!)
